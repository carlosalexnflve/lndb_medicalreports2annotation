[You can change the location of the LNDETECTOR Database in the main.py code]

chars_trainNodules.csv:
[same format as trainNodules.csv with Characteristics {Calcification, InternalStructure, Lobulation, Malignancy, Sphericity, Spiculation, Subtlety}]

report.csv:
[Up to 6 instances in the dataset, attributes described in the paper]
- num_report: CT/medical text report ID;
- loc: nodule location;
- unc: uncertainty parameter;
- rem: remaining attributes, namely location2, lesion type, size, and characteristics.

allNods.csv:
- LNDbID: CT/medical text report ID;
- RadID: Radiologist ID who annotated the nodule;
- RadFinding: ID corresponding to when the radiologist annotated;
- FindingID: Unique ID for nodule identification;
- Nodule: 1 if it is a nodule, 0 if it is a non-nodule, given for the number of radiologists who annotated;
- World coordinates {x, y, z};
- DiamEq_Rad: Equivalent diameter of the segmentation that was done;
- Characteristics (average of radiologists' annotations) {Texture, Calcification, InternalStructure, Lobulation, Malignancy, Sphericity, Spiculation, Subtlety};
- Lobe: 1 'LUL', 2 'LLL', 3 'RUL', 4 'ML', 5 'RLL';
- TextInstanceID: ID of the instance where it appears in the medical report;
- TextQuestion: Uncertainty parameter;
- Pos_Text: location2;
- Diam_Text: diameter written in the medical report;
- NodType: nodule type;
- Caract_Text: characteristics related to the nodule in the medical report;
- Where: whether this nodule is in the medical report, radiologist's annotation, or both.
[All nodules found between image annotations and in the medical reports]

rad2Fleischner.csv and text2Fleischner.csv:
- LNDbID: CT/medical text report ID;
- FindingID: Unique ID for nodule identification;
- Nodule: 1 if at least 1 radiologist considered it as a nodule, 0 otherwise;
- Volume: average volume of the segmentation;
- Texture: average texture of the annotation or as specified in the medical report;
- Where: whether this nodule is in the medical report, radiologist's annotation, or both
[rad2Fleischner.csv contains only the image annotated nodules, and text2Fleischner.csv contains those reported in the medical reports]
